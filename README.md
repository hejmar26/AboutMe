# About me #

My name is Marta and I am a Beginner Manual Tester. 

I started my IT adventure a few months ago. During this time, I completed the
Coders Lab - Manual Tester course, where I gained theoretical knowledge about
testing and learned technologies and tools such as Postman, SQL, and DevTools. 
I earned an ISTQB certificate and continued to improve my skills through various
online courses, including Udemy.I am a careful, hardworking and highly motivated
person, always eager to further develop my abilities. Currently, I am helping to
create software for managing the finances of a dental office and testing the beta
version from the user's perspective.
