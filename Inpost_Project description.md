# PROJECT | THE FIRST JOB - MANUAL SOFTWARE TESTER
### APPLYING KNOWLEDGE IN PRACTICE - ALIGNED WITH ISTQB SYLLABUS

#### 1.	PROJECT OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project is to demonstrate Marta Hejmej's capabilities in manual software testing, by putting into practice the knowledge acquired through ISTQB certification and further skill-enhancing activities. Tester Marta makes use of tools commonly used in commercial projects, including GitHub, Jira, and DevTools, to continually improve her skills.
#### 2.	PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project initiator is Jakub GÃ³ral. One of the project's assumptions is to work with agile methodologies, therefore, the team did not choose a management structure, but operates based on the principles of self-organizing teams, although it documents almost all of its activities with the aim of realizing the main project goal.
The first meeting of the project team members was held online on 13.02.2023 using the Google Meet platform. The principles of team member operation and the tools with which the project will be implemented were established. Members collectively chose the first product to be tested. They created the first backlog and divided responsibilities.


#### 3.	PROJECT TEAM
Marta and Jakub met during a two-week manual testing course. As engaged individuals in the life of the course participants, they quickly established a professional relationship based on the profession they aspire to. They supported each other in their studies and preparation for ISTQB certification. Both Marta and Jakub faced a common problem during the stage of searching for their first job as a Manual Software Tester - a lack of commercial experience.

##### Marta Hejmej

As a highly motivated and hardworking individual, I have always been eager to pursue a career in the field of manual testing. My attention to detail, commitment, and responsibility make me a strong candidate for any testing team. I began my IT journey a few months ago by completing a manual tester course at Coders Lab IT School and earning an ISTQB certificate. During this time, I gained a solid understanding of the theories and practices of testing, as well as practical knowledge of tools and technologies such as Postman, SQL, and DevTools. Additionally, I took several online courses on Udemy and completed the uTest Academy, where I received valuable insights and hands-on experience in the testing process. Currently, I am helping to create software for managing the finances of a dental office and testing its beta version from a user's perspective.
